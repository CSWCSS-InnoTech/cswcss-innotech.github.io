## Current Project

### STEM Collaboration with Good Counsel Catholic Primary School

In partnership with Dyson, ICT-in-PE Foundation and other organizations, we have launched a STEM collaboration programme with Good Counsel Catholic Primary School. A total of 20 primary 5 and 6 students at Good Counsel are taught by InnoTech members on how to develop apps using MIT App Inventor 2. 

The aim of the project is to raise awareness of our increasing carbon footprint and promote ways to tackle the problem. We collect data about the use of tissue paper and dryers for drying hands, store the data with cloud technologies, analyse and calculate the carbon footprint, finally presenting the result using interactive ways and infographics.

### InnoTech eLearn Platform

Our eLearning platform developed for students by students, incorporating cloud technologies to benefit students in both academic and extra-curricular activities. Developed using Xamarin for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.

### Modern Technologies

Being in close relationship with major technology companies, such as IBM, Dyson, Microsoft, Citrix, students at InnoTech are often provided with the latest technologies. We are also the first local school in Hong Kong to use and develop using the Microsoft Hololens, an MR headset.
